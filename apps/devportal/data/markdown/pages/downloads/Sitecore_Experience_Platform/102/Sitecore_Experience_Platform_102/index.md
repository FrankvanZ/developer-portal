Sitecore Experience Platform 10.2
=================================

Sitecore® Experience Platform™ 10.2 focuses on increasing performance and stability while helping to reduce costs so organizations can deliver unforgettable experiences faster than ever before. By providing the ability to incrementally convert to headless Sitecore architectures without a full rebuild, 10.2 also offers a bridge to our composable DXP for those who are interested in that path.

In addition, the developer experience is also vastly improved in 10.2 thanks to increases in agility and capabilities in SXA, publishing enhancements, headless rendering, and general upgrades and improvements.

Other highlights include:

*   EXM DDS Container Support: Dedicated email dispatch servers (DDS) are supported in Kubernetes and Docker compose files allowing for quicker setup.
*   Introduction of GetTargetContact: Helps deliver efficient communication between tracker and xConnect to help increase overall performance.
*   UX Improvements in Experience Analytics: Gives marketers more control of and access to their data, providing better visualization and more actionable reporting for stakeholders.
*   Personalization Effect Reporting: Marketers can now see the impact of personalization on the conversions for individual goals which helps evaluate campaign effectiveness.
*   Data Purge on Interactions: The ability to purge interactions, based on date, channel or if they contain a certain event.
*   Streamlined Horizon editing: Further enhancemens of SXA on Horizon provides an a more integrated coherent platform and streamlined editing experiences.
*   Scriban Template Improvements: Now at full parity with the classic Rendering Variants, frontend developers have more flexibility to fully express the HTML without the need to log in to Sitecore.
*   Headless Rendering 19.0: Includes enhancements and new documentation to facilitate the inclusion of Sitecore MVC components in the output of the Layout Service and Experience Edge, and conversion of existing Sitecore MVC sites to Jamstack architectures using Next.js.
*   Sitecore CLI 4.0: Provides improved release velocity with Items as resource plugin and security role serialization.
