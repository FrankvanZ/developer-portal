=========================================

This page contains all the resources for **Sitecore Experience Platform 8.0 rev. 151127 (8.0 Update-6)**. To access Sitecore Experience Platform 8.0 rev. 141212 (8.0 Initial Release), click [here](/downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform/8_0/Sitecore_Experience_Platform_8_0) or see [all available 8.0 updates](/downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform/8_0).

*   Sitecore strongly urges customers on earlier versions of 8.0 to upgrade to 8.0 update-6 at the earliest possible opportunity.
*   Please note — although you will find all the new documentation for Sitecore 8 on [the Documentation site](http://doc.sitecore.net), much of the [SDN documentation for 7.0 - 7.5](http://sdn.sitecore.net/Reference/Sitecore%207) is still relevant. SDN documentation is in the process of being converted and migrated.
