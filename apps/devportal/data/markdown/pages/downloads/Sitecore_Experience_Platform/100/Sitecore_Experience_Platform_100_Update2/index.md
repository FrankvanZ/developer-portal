Sitecore Experience Platform 10.0 Update-2
==========================================

Sitecore® Experience Platform™ 10.0 focuses on product updates and enhancements that provide more development and deployment options, increase usability and improve overall performance – all centered around enabling both Marketing and IT teams equally, thus making it easier and faster to launch and evolve digital customer experiences.

New delivery options including support for Docker, Kubernetes and new Sitecore-provided image repositories, helping delivery teams move to a continuous delivery model more easily with infrastructure-as-code deployments and more efficient solution and team onboarding. The addition of the ASP.NET Core SDK and headless rendering host architecture also provides developers with a new way of building their solutions allowing for faster development iterations.

Other highlights include:

*   Sitecore Containers support rapid deployment and more efficient solution and team onboarding with modern Docker and Kubernetes technology.
*   A new ASP.NET Core headless development option allows teams to build applications faster on the latest .NET technology.
*   Sitecore CLI and Sitecore for Visual Studio bring headless serialization by combining the best of TDS and Unicorn , making it easy for teams to script content changes and move them between different environments as part of deployment processes.
*   Audience analytics filters allow for deeper insights on audience engagement and segmentation to drive powerful personalization across all your channels.
*   Additional HTML Email Templates for EXM provide more options when crafting emails, which translates to the quicker creation and delivery of targeted emails to customer inboxes.
*   Horizon editing interface updates give marketers in-context insight across multilingual and multisite experiences.
*   Stronger CMP integration supports additional field types and allows for persistent taxonomy associations when importing into XP taxonomy repositories and connecting CMP to XP.
*   Salesforce Marketing Cloud (SFMC) connector updates provide new capabilities to immediately send xDB data and trigger Salesforce Marketing Cloud plans in Journey Builder.
*   New marketing automation capabilities include capabilities to engage customers with automated birthday campaigns.
*   Support for GDPR compliance journeys including features that make it easier to enforce and manage consent options as well as supporting the anonymization of personal information submitted via Sitecore Forms.
