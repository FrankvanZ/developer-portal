Looking for **a different version**? See [all available versions](/downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform).

**EXM is now included with Sitecore**  
• With Sitecore 9.0 Update-1, EXM does not need to be installed as a separate module.  
• You can only migrate EXM to Sitecore XP 9.0 Update 1. It is not part of the Sitecore XP 9.0 Update 1 upgrade procedure.  
• Find the relevant resources for migrating EXM 3.5 to Sitecore 9.0 Update-1 on the [Email Experience Manager in Sitecore 9.0 Update-1 page](https://dev.sitecore.net/Downloads/Email_Experience_Manager/90/Email_Experience_Manager_in_Sitecore_90_Update1).

**Sitecore 9.0 now includes Device Detection as standard in the platform.**  
To access the new Device Detection features requires you to have a valid license file. If your license file is not valid, Sitecore will not enable the Device Detection features and Experience Device Data will not be aggregated. Any customers or partners without a valid license to Experience Platform should contact their account manager or [login to SPN](http://spn.sitecore.net/default) for an updated license.
