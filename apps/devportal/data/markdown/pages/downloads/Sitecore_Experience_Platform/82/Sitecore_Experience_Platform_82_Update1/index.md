Sitecore Experience Platform 8.2 Update-1
=========================================

Sitecore 8.2 builds on the core functionality released on the 8.x platform and continues to incorporate feedback we have received from customers, partners, and analysts to strengthen the platform since Sitecore 8.0 was released. Commerce usability and functionality have been improved and additional modules such as Experience Accelerator and Express Migrations have been introduced to help customers speed implementation times and assist with moving to the modern 8.x platform.

Sitecore 8.2 Update-1 supports a full Azure PaaS deployment and the release comes with out of the box support for:

*   Azure Web Apps for hosting your Sitecore site
*   Application Insights for health monitoring
*   Redis Cache for session state
*   Azure Search for search engine support
*   Azure SQL for databases

This page contains all the resources for **Sitecore Experience Platform 8.2 rev. 161115 (8.2 Update-1)**.

Looking for **a different version**? See [all available 8.x versions](/downloads/Sitecore_Experience_Platform).

*   Note: xDB Cloud support will be released approximately 6 weeks after the release of the Sitecore Experience Platform.
